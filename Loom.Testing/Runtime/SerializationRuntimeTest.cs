/// <remarks>
///     Each case pairs a Loom snapshot with a Luau assertion body of the same name under
///     <c>Runtime/</c>. The two are assembled with <c>Runtime/prelude.luau</c>, which stubs the Roblox
///     surface the serializers touch and the runtime helpers they call, then run on an embedded Luau.
///     The interpreter ships with the package, so these need nothing installed and run everywhere the
///     rest of the suite does.
